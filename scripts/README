PCA_919x919_matrix.rds    R object produced by PCA (Fig. S1, step 7( of the 919 cell 2000 genes matrix (Fig. S1, step 6). The 'x' slot contains a 919 cell 919 PC matrix that was used for downstream analyses (Fig. S1, step 7)

best_scoring_jumble_trees_Mah&Dunn2023.tsv   The 14 highest scoring jumble trees that were tied for 'best tree'. Tree 1 was chosen as the focal phylogeny (Fig. 4).

positive_NCBI_gene_descriptions_Mah&Dunn2023.tsv    TSV table of top 10 most positively loaded genes for each PC, with their HGNC gene symbol, HGNC full gene name and NCBI gene database summary.

negative_NCBI_gene_descriptions_Mah&Dunn2023.tsv    TSV table of top 10 most negatively loaded genes for each PC, with their HGNC gene symbol, HGNC full gene name and NCBI gene database summary.
